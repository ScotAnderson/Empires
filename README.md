# Empires
Totally functional! Still has some minor bugs, but is mostly playable. Doesn't currently detect and end when all human players are dead.

Remake of an old text game (Rats ate 23% of the grain reserve)

Original Empire game was by Peter Trefonas, it also credited these games:
- Hammurabi by Rick Merril & David AHL
- Santa Paravia by George Blank

I played the DOS version of this game when I was younger and loved it. I haven't found a copy of the DOS version, but I was able to find a version of the game for TRS-80, which is allowing me to remake it so it is easier to play and has less bugs. (The original version breaks all the time.)

This game was alternately called Empires, or Empire. But Empire also refers to a more famous game from roughly the same period. If you are expecting an ascii map that you move armies around, that is the other game and you should keep looking. If you are expecting to attack barbarians and other nations to get land, and hiring solders, and managing your grain and serfs, this is probably the game you are looking for.

You can play the TRS-80 version in an emulator online here:
